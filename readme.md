Minimal rsync deployment

## Usage

```
npm i rploy -D
```

Add source and destination options to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "rploy": {
    "source": "public/",
    "destination": "user@ip:/var/www/public/"
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can create an `rploy.config.js` file in your document root:
```js
module.exports = () => {
  return {
    source: 'public/',
    destination: "user@ip:/var/www/public/",
  }
}
```

Deploy:

```
npx rploy
```

## Config

`rploy` wraps [`node-rsync`](https://github.com/mattijs/node-rsync), so you can pass any relevant options to configure flags, progress, excludes, etc. Here is an example:

```json
{
  "rploy": {
    "source": "public/",
    "destination": "user@ip:/var/www/public/",
    "exclude": [
      ".DS_Store",
      "Icon",
      "node_modules",
      ".git"
    ],
    "progress": true
  }
}
```

## Branches

When deploying git repositories, `rploy` offers a `branches` option, which provides a way to be explicit about a destination for each branch:

```json
{
  "rploy": {
    "source": "public/",
    "branches": {
      "master": "user@ip:/var/www/prod/public/",
      "dev": "user@ip:/var/www/dev/public/"
    }
  }
}
```

You will now be notified of your current working branch and the destination:

<br>This provides an easy way to prevent issues like accidentally deploying your staging branch to production. It will always check your working branch and look for a deploy context. You can even pass `node-rsync` options into each branch, to get even more granular:

```json
{
  "rploy": {
    "source": "public/",
    "branches": {
      "master": {
        "destination": "user@ip:/var/www/prod/public/",
        "exclude": [
          "readme.md"
        ]
      },
      "dev": {
        "destination": "user@ip:/var/www/dev/public/",
        "delete": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tips

- I recommend adding your ssh key to the server you are deploying to, for easy passwordless auth.
- Use a lifecycle script to build assets before a deploy:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "parcel src/index.js",
    "deploy": "npx rploy",
    "predeploy": "npm run build"
  },
  "rploy": {
    "source": "public/",
    "destination": "user@ip:/var/www/public/"
  }
}
```

## Why?

I‚Äôve been using a similar little bash script to deploy things with rsync for a while. Figured should finally package this up since there somehow still seems to be a lack of simple deployment tools for ‚Äúwebsites.‚Äù This brings some of the ease of deploying to platforms like [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [vercel](https://vercel.com), but without any ecosystem. Works great with traditional php projects, like [kirby](https://getkirby.com/). `git`-based deployment is also cool, but sometimes it‚Äôs nice to have them decoupled, to quickly deploy to staging during dev, for example.

Provided as-is, but hopefully you find it useful! ü•Ç
